`ctrlkit` is a library written in Go that expedites the development of Kubernetes controllers. It provides a set of
interfaces and utilities that can be used to build controllers that are easy to test and maintain. The `ctrlkit` library
is designed to be used in conjunction with the [controller-runtime](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime).
